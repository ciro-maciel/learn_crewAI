# ## Creating the Crew
# - The `Process` class helps to delegate the workflow to the Agents (kind of like a Manager at work)
# - In the example below, it will run this hierarchically.
# - `manager_llm` lets you choose the "manager" LLM you want to use.

# Define the crew with agents and tasks
financial_trading_crew = Crew(
    agents=[data_analyst_agent, 
            trading_strategy_agent, 
            execution_agent,

    tasks=[data_analysis_task, 
           strategy_development_task, 
           execution_planning_task, 
           risk_assessment_task],
    
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0.7),
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    
    verbose=True
)

# ## Running the Crew
# 
# - Set the inputs for the execution of the crew.

# Example data for kicking off the process
financial_trading_inputs = {
    'stock_selection': 'AAPL',
    'initial_capital': '100000',
    'risk_tolerance': 'Medium',
    'trading_strategy_preference': 'Day Trading',
    'news_impact_consideration': True
}

# **Note**: LLMs can provide different outputs for they same input, so what you get might be different than what you see in the video.

### this execution will take some time to run
result = financial_trading_crew.kickoff(inputs=financial_trading_inputs)
